Notes :

1. We can use relationships using methods & property
   * method
	$product->productColors()
   * property
	$product->productColors
   - In both case we need to define productColors() method in a model
2. Active nav-tab :
	{{request()->is('categories')?'active-nav':'in-active-nav'}}
3. {!! $product->description !!} 
	It's called "unescaped output" 
	HTML tags within the description will be interpreted as HTML and rendered accordingly.
4. Auth::check() 
	- to check weather user is logged in or not!
5. * <a href="#" targer="_blank"></a>
	- openes every product in a new tab.
   * <a href="#" targer="blank"></a>
	- openes one single new tab for every product
	- tab is same for all products
6. WishList::where('user_id',auth()->user()->id)->where('product_id',$product_id)->exists()
   * returns true or false
   * use to check the row in table
7. date('d / m / Y') 
   * For current date
8. Route::get('/home','HomeController@index')->name('index');
   * use to call the index method of home controller using route name ('index')
9. store image 
   *  $imageName = $this->image->store('public');
10. Request::get('search')  
   * get the value of search form the url
